# ParkSmart

A ParkSmar system implemented using an ESP8266 microcontroller and Blynk for IoT control. The system utilizes infrared (IR) sensors to detect the presence of vehicles in parking spaces and provides real-time status updates through the Blynk app.

## Features

- **IR Sensor Monitoring**: Detects vehicle presence in up to five parking spaces.
- **LED Indicators**: Provides visual status for each parking space through LEDs.
- **Blynk Integration**: Controls and monitors the parking spaces remotely via the Blynk app.

## Requirements

- ESP8266 microcontroller
- 5 IR Sensors
- 5 LEDs
- Blynk App Account
